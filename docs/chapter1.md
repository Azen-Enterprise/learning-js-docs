### Chapter 1: Introduction

> We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.

## History and What it is

```
JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possible— applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.
It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by mar- keting considerations rather than good judgment. When JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.
After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language.
There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of these things are true. When I was required to write something in JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to despise it. It would accept almost anything I typed but interpret it in a way that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you.
This flexibility also has its advantages, though. It leaves space for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more rigid languages, and as you will see (for example in Chapter 10), it can be used to overcome some of JavaScript’s shortcomings. After learning the language properly and working with it for a while, I have learned to actually like JavaScript.
There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript version 3 was the widely supported version in the time of JavaScript’s ascent to dominance, roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was underway on an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical improvements and extensions to the language.

Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in 1995 while working for Netscape.

Netscape sought to develop a scripting language that could help make early versions of the World Wide Web more dynamic.

JavaScript quickly gained popularity as developers realized its ability to add dynamism and interactivity to webpages.

In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA International), an organization that aims to standardize the use of information technology systems.

This led to the creation of the `ECMAScript` standard, the formal specifications for JavaScript.

Despite similarities in name, JavaScript is entirely different from Java.

### Libraries Vs Frameworks

Libraries are collections of prewritten code that can be used to easily implement frequently used JavaScript tasks.

Libraries lead to faster development because developers don’t need to write every line of code.

Frameworks are collections of libraries.

Think of libraries as tools. And frameworks as fully loaded toolboxes.

Although a library can provide code for a specific function on your website, a framework can provide all the code you need to build the website.

Common JavaScript libraries include jQuery and React. Common JavaScript frameworks include Vue.js, Node.js, and Angular.

### What can Javascript be used for?

Javascript can be used in almost any thing. Some places it could be used in include: Web development, mobile development, game development, artificial Intelligence and even chatbots such as `ChatGPT`, are built using Javascript.

- Javascript is an _interpreted Language_ meaning it can be executed directly in a browser.

- It uses _dynamic typing_ meaning variable types are associated with runtime values, not named or declared fields.

- It allows developers to write code faster, as they don't to worry about specifying variable types.

* It is ubiquitous meaning it is becoming a general purpose language
